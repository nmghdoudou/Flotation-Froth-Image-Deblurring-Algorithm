# Flotation-Froth-Image-Deblurring-Algorithm
A Deblurring Algorithm for Deblurring Flotation Froth Images

A bubble image deblurring method based on decoupled representation. The decoupled representation is achieved by separating the content and fuzzy features in a fuzzy image using a content encoder and a fuzzy encoder to achieve de-blurring of foam images.
